# Neural-Networks
This repository uses a basic Mnist dataset from keras to differentiate the use of both the whitebox and blackbox neural network systems. The activation function used for the blackbox neural network is the ReLu function. 
The whitebox NN model is written in Python using seperate functions for the following things- 
--> Generation of weights
--> Forward propagation
--> Backward Propagation
--> Training the model
--> Prediction
